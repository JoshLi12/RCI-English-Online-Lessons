# RCI English Online Recorded Lessons

Description: Stores recorded lessons in an easily accessible website for seniors to access and review past lessons. 

Motivation:
  I took on this website after I realized that students usually go over a lesson once, then moves on. For seniors, it might be difficult to learn something once and       remember it. I have received many requests by my students, and my students' friends to record certain lessons, which gave me the inspiration to build a website that     they can access anytime to review past lessons. 

Technologies:
  HTML, CSS, and Javascript
  Used Backendless database to store user feedback information
